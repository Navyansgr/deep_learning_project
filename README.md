📊 Problem Statement

A manufacturing company produces two products (A & B). Each product requires labor hours and raw materials. The objective is to maximize profit while ensuring constraints are met.

🔢 Given Data

⚠️ Constraints

Labor Hours Available = 100 hours

Raw Materials Available = 120 kg

🔍 Solution Approach

1. Define Decision Variables:

A = Number of Product A units produced

B = Number of Product B units produced



2. Define Objective Function (Maximize Profit):

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Deep Learning model using TensorFlow/Keras for:

1️⃣ Image Classification (CNN) – Classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2️⃣ Sentiment Analysis (LSTM) – Predicts sentiment (Positive/Negative) from text.

The project includes model training, evaluation, and inference scripts.

🖼️ Option 1: Image Classification (CNN)

🔹 Training the Model

python train.py

This trains a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and saves it as cnn_model.h5.

🔹 Testing on a New Image

python inference.py

Make sure the image (test_image.jpg) is in the project folder.

📝 Option 2: Sentiment Analysis (LSTM)

🔹 Training the Model

python train.py

This trains an LSTM model for sentiment analysis and saves it as lstm_model.h5.

🔹 Predicting Sentiment of a New Text

python inference.py

Modify inference.py to input your own text.
📊 Results & Visualization

For Image Classification, the model predicts the class of an image.

For Sentiment Analysis, the model predicts if a text is Positive or Negative.

📌 Future Improvements

Improve accuracy with data augmentation (for images) and more training data (for text).

Use pretrained models like VGG16 (for images) or BERT (for NLP).

Deploy the model using Flask/FastAPI for real-world applications.
